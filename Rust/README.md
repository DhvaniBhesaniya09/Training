# Rust 

#### Overview
This repository contains  projects written in Rust: `MyProject` , `Grpc_client_server` , `Wasm` and `tikv-crud`.

## [MyProject](https://github.com/dhvanibhesaniya-inventyv/Training/tree/main/Rust/Myproject)
This repository serves as a collection of Rust modules showcasing various functionalities and examples. Each module provides insights into different aspects of Rust programming.

## [Grpc_client_server](https://github.com/dhvanibhesaniya-inventyv/Training/tree/main/Rust/Grpc_client_server)
This project encompasses client and server modules for gRPC communication. The client side module facilitates calling functions and passing request parameters for CRUD operations, while the server side module handles these requests and sends back responses.

## [Wasm](https://github.com/dhvanibhesaniya-inventyv/Training/tree/main/Rust/Wasm)
This project is aimed at demonstrating how to use WebAssembly (`Wasm`) in a Rust project to process JSON data and perform table-related functionalities. The project utilizes Rust, Node.js, and WebAssembly to achieve this.


## [tikv-crud](https://github.com/dhvanibhesaniya-inventyv/Training/tree/main/Rust/tikv-crud)
This project performs CRUD operations on a TiKV database using Rust. It establishes a connection to the TiKV database and executes operations such as insertion, retrieval, updating, and deletion of JSON data stored in the database as key-value pairs.



## Additional Information
For Rust documentation, you can run `rustup doc` anywhere in the Rust environment. If using a Cargo project, you can generate and open documentation with `cargo doc --open`. To execute a specific binary file, you can use `cargo run -q --bin file_name`.
